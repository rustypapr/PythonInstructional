    "Programming is about automating complex processes by breaking them down into finite steps. We have some tools; variables let us hold and manipulate granular pieces of information. Functions are pre-programmed operations we can use to manipulate variables. We could manually split a file header using a lot of code, but it's nice to have a `split` function. Since we work with such granular pieces of information, its often necessary to perform the same operations many times. Thats why we use loops. Finally, we often need to make decisions - if the new file showed up then start processing it otherwise just keep waiting.<br>\n",

    "Ok, if there is one secret, it's understanding how the tools can work together so that you start combining them. With python it's possible to do <b>a lot</b> on a single line. That isn't the goal because it makes code that is impossible to read. But being comfortable with the tools allows a faster expression of ideas.  "

Instead of telling the computer what to do, it says, \"I already told you how to do this, follow those instructions again!\" They can take arguments or parameters (variables, and values) like an `f(x)` function that performs some calculation, or they dont need to - like a function that checks for new files. Both of those might return a value - the answer to the calculation, or the alert that a new file was found. And other functions, like one that prints, doesn't return anything. We call functions all the time. If we use a word we haven't defined, but we follow it with `( )` and it does something, then it's a function. We have seen  `map()`, `zip()`, `print()`,`.keys()`, `.split()`, `.join()`, `.upper()`, `.lower()` to name a few. The last 5 are part of classes and can only be called from specific objects, which have inhereted the class properties and functions. It's fine if that doesn't make sense yet becuase we aren't creating classes, we're creating a function. <br>\n",
    "The function will multiply the value of each denomination by the number of them in the register. 4 Twenties is $80. The amounts for all denominations will be added together to get the register total. The function will know how much each denomination is worth, it just need to know how many of each the register has, and those are it's inputs. Its output will be the total of everything. "
