    "Programming is about automating complex processes by breaking them down into finite steps. We have some tools; variables let us hold an manipulate granular pieces of information. Functions are pre-programmed operations we can use to manipulate variables. We could manually split a file header using a lot of code, but its nice to have a split function. Since we work with such granular pieces of information, its often necessary to perform the same operations many times. Thats why we use loops. Finally, we often need to make decisions - if the new file showed up then start processing it otherwise just keep waiting."
