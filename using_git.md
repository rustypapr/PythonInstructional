# Creating Pull Requests

There are two fundamentally different approaches to collaborating that are based on the level of access granted to the remote repository. If a user is a collaborator they can directly branch the repo and create merge requests against it. If a user is not a collaborator, they can <i>fork</i> the repository to their own account, make changes and push them there, and then create a pull request for the remote repository to pull in the changes from their forked version. 

### Forks

### Collaborators
Users must first be added as collaborators by the owner of the repo. <br>

Users can now create their own branches with `git checkout -b <branch-name>`.
